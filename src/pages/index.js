          It is simultaneously a chance to check out Gatsby and Netlify
          CMS/Deployment and to post things I always end up googling because I
          forget them, or things I consistently implement in projects that I can
          copy in to new ones as and when I need them.

          It'll probably include links to things I've found useful too. Who
          knows. If any of my attempts to do things of this type are anything to
          go by I'll add a few examples then forget about it and carry on
          googling.
